## Introduction & Motivation

This project explores [briefly describe the topic] through a series of experiments inspired by recent academic work in the field. The primary goal is to [state the main objective, e.g., replicate findings, test a new hypothesis, explore variations of an algorithm].

## Inspiration

This work is inspired by the following paper(s):

* **s1: Simple test-time scaling**. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) [[repo]](https://github.com/simplescaling/s1)
    * s1 show that 
* **[Paper Title 2]** by [Author(s)] ([Year]). [[Link to Paper or DOI]]([URL])
    * *Briefly mention how this paper inspired your work.*
* ## Goals

The specific goals of this project are:

* [Goal 1, e.g., Implement the algorithm described in Paper X]
* [Goal 2, e.g., Run experiments to reproduce Figure Y from Paper Z]
* [Goal 3, e.g., Test the approach on a different dataset/scenario]
* ## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Repository Folder Name]
    ```
2.  **Set up environment (e.g., Python virtual environment):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    ## Usage

* **To run Experiment A:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/run_experiment_a.py --parameter [value]
    ```
* **To process data:**
    ```bash
    python data_processing/preprocess.py --input data/raw --output data/processed
    ```
* ## Experiments

* **Experiment 1: [Descriptive Name]**
    * *Objective:* [What this experiment aims to test]
    * *Setup:* [Specific configurations, datasets used]
    * *Corresponding Code:* `[path/to/script.py]`
* **Experiment 2: [Descriptive Name]**
    * *Objective:* [What this experiment aims to test]
    * *Setup:* [Specific configurations, datasets used]
    * *Corresponding Code:* `[path/to/another_script.py]`
* ## Results

Preliminary results can be found in the `results/` directory or visualized in [e.g., `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`]. Key findings include:

* [Finding 1]
* [Finding 2]

## Future Work

* [Idea 1, e.g., Explore the effect of parameter X]
* [Idea 2, e.g., Apply the method to a real-world problem]
* [Idea 3, e.g., Compare against baseline Y]
